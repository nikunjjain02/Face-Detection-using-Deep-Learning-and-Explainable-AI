# Facial and Ocular Recognition with MTCNN, LIME

**Project Name:** Advancements in Facial and Ocular Recognition using MTCNN and Interpretable Machine Learning

## Objective:
This project focuses on enhancing facial and ocular recognition capabilities using the Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) algorithm. Additionally, it incorporates interpretability tools such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to provide insights into the decision-making process of the model.

## Overview:
The project delves into the application of machine learning techniques, specifically MTCNN, for precise face and eye detection. It not only explores state-of-the-art facial and ocular algorithms but also aims to improve interpretability through LIME and SHAP. The integration of these tools enables a more comprehensive understanding of the model's decisions, contributing to both performance reviews and ethical considerations in facial and ocular recognition systems.

## About:
The core of the project involves designing and implementing novel models for face and eye detection, applicable in various scenarios such as airport security, iris detection for authentication, and fraud detection using CCTV. The paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on machine learning approaches to face and eye recognition, providing new examples and ethical considerations.
